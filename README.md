Don't forget to put out the trash. ESP8266 OLED reminder (for Esslingen)


ESP8266_OLED_HW-364A Trash Pickup Calendar Program
Welcome to your new favorite way of keeping track of trash pickups (who knew it could be so exciting?)! This program is designed specifically for the ESP8266_OLED_HW-364A board, which comes with a nifty OLED display for showing off your trash schedule.

I got mylittle device here, but there are many more resources:

What does it do?
This program gets your ICL Calendar from AWB-ES so that youâ€™ll never miss a trash pickup again. ðŸŽ‰

Setup Instructions:
Change the aipUrl: You'll need to adjust the aipUrl to match your own trash scheduleâ€™s .ics file. You can grab it here:
https://www.awb-es.de/abfuhr/abfuhrtermine/abfuhrtermine-suchen.html

For some LED bling: Want a flashing light when itâ€™s trash day? Sure! Just hook up an LED to D2 and Ground, and youâ€™ll have your very own optical alarm.

Disclaimer:
I am not liable if your trash is missed, your board catches fire, or the LED blinds you with its brilliance. Use at your own riskâ€”if your trash isnâ€™t picked up, blame the calendar, not me!
